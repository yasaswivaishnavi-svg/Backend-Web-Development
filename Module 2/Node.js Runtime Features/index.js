/**
 * Node.js Runtime Features — Streams, Buffers & the File System
 *
 * GOAL
 * Move the SAME file two different ways and feel the difference:
 *   1) Load the whole file into memory with fs.readFile, and log its size.
 *   2) Flow the file through a stream and pipe it to a writable stream (a copy).
 * Then explain, in your own words, why the stream approach is preferable for
 * large files.
 *
 * The starter already imports `fs` and `path` for you and points at a large
 * sample file (`sample-data.txt`) that lives next to this script.
 *
 * Run it with:  npm start
 */

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Absolute, OS-safe path to the sample file (do NOT hand-build paths with '+').
const INPUT = path.join(__dirname, 'sample-data.txt');
const OUTPUT = path.join(__dirname, 'sample-copy.txt');

// ── PART 1: read the whole file into memory, then log its size ──────────────
function readWholeFile() {
  fs.readFile(INPUT, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      return;
    }

    console.log(`readFile: loaded ${data.length} bytes into memory`);
  });
}

// ── PART 2: stream the file and pipe it to a writable stream ────────────────
function streamFile() {
  const readable = fs.createReadStream(INPUT);
  const writable = fs.createWriteStream(OUTPUT);

  readable.pipe(writable);

  writable.on('finish', () => {
    console.log('stream: finished copying via chunks (flat memory)');
  });
}

// ── PART 3: explain the difference ──────────────────────────────────────────
/*
readFile loads the whole file into memory at once, so memory usage increases
as the file size increases. A stream moves the file in smaller chunks, so it
does not need to keep the entire file in memory and peak memory stays mostly
flat even when the file is very large.
*/

// Run both approaches.
readWholeFile();
streamFile();

module.exports = { readWholeFile, streamFile, INPUT, OUTPUT };
